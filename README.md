# My super cool media player
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Goal
I want to build one media player to use both spotify and local files.
#### Why?
Well... I've a lot of .flac files which I would like to listen to. But if I would listen to them locally it wouldn't add up to the end of the year Spotify and a personal goal of mine is to always listen to more than the year before. 

#### Features

 - [x] Support playing local files
 - [ ] Support upnp
 - [ ]  Sync play session with spotify 
 - [ ]  Support last.fm
- [ ] Make things look pretty
# End Goal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first part of larger project I wish to achive. The next part is, to combine this player with a Rasspi/ Audrino to allow music recognition, Lyrics display and some cool responsive lights
